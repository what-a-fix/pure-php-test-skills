     * This method use the extended boolean model.
     *
     * The model is defined by the function sim(operator, document)
     * Available operator are AND & OR
     * Only AND is needed in our case
     *
     * So getTags method is defined by this set of equations :
     *
     * - sim(D) = 1 - (n - w¹ - w² - w³ - ... - wⁿ) / n ; it is the simplified version when p=1
     *   where :
     *   - D is the text given in the sim method in the form of a wordBag, structured as is :
     *     keys are a therm and values are the number of times that therm occurs
     *   - wⁿ the weight of the tⁿ, where tⁿ is the n term defined by the w(tⁿ) equation
     *
     * - w(tⁿ) = tf(tⁿ) / ∑tD
     *   where :
     *   - ∑tD is the sum of therms in D
     *   - tf(tⁿ) is the number of time that therm occurs
     *
     * And perform this algorithm :
     *
     * - Set ∑tD, will refer to it as $totalOfTerms. $totalOfTerms can simply be defined with the summing of D values
     * - Calculate each wⁿ, will refer to it as $wns
     * - Calculate sim(D), will refer to it as $sim.
     *   Will perform the calculus of sim according to defined therms given by ThemeInterface passed in constructor and choose to construct the sim request only when matching element are present
     *
     * - return sim
