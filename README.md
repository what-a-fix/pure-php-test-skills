# Let's try to do a light PHP library

## Specifications

- The library should solve this specific problem : tagging a text with specific attributes according to it's content.

## At your disposal to start the project

- [x] Interface that define the public library API

## What we expect

- [ ] A functional library of course :)

- [ ] The library MUST be tested, so you have to provide unit testing series in the project

## I don't really understand specs !

Ok, let me show you an example :

- Let's say we've got two text (french text) :

  - 1 : Cette après-midi je suis allé manger une glace avec mes parents au parc. Puis nous avons fait une grande ballade.
  - 2 : Une fuite dans mon appartement au niveau de ma baignoire, on dirait que cela vient de la bonde.

- So, tags returned for sentence 1 should be something like : 

```php
[
    'family',
    'walk',
];
```

- And tags for sentence 2 should be something like : 

```php
[
    'leak',
    'bathroom',
];
```

This is a proof of concept , you don't have to create the whole scope for any kind of thematics tag. Keep focus about one or two thematics, and make it works and detect well...

# My solution

For now, I just made this quick, functional and simple text-tagger. 
There's a lot of improvements to be done, but for this specific case it works fine.

The textTagger method will scan the provided text for certain keywords, and when one is encountered, the associate tag will be added.
We then keep only unique tags and sort the array before returning it.
